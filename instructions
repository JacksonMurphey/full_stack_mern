1. Check to make sure that a repo has not been setup. Also Make sure that this folder isnt nested inside of a folder that already has a repo setup for it.
   -> In your terminal type: ls -al
   -> cd back up to parent folders if needed to check them as well.

2. Run this command in your terminal (as long as no repo has been setup): git init

3. Run this command in your terminal after initialization: mkdir server

4. Then run: npx create-react-app client
   -> This is the best practices naming convention going forward.
   -> When you run create-react-app, React would normally initialize or create a git-repo for you. Since we did this already, it knows to skip doing it for us.

5. Create a .gitignore in the root folder of your project.
   -> In .gitignore add: node_modules/
   -> Our client folder, which holds our react-app has a gitignore file as well. We created our root .gitignore b/c our server folder will also get a node_modules folder

6. Create server.js inside your server folder
   -> once done: cd into your server folder

7. Run: npm init -y
   -> This generates our package.json file

8.
