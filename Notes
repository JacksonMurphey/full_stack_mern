**_ --- Login/Registration Middleware --- _**

PRE:
--> Pre middleware functions are executed one after another, when each middleware calls 'next'

Example:
    const schema = new Schema(...)
    schema.pre('save', function(next) {
        // Code on what to do
        next();
    })

--> This 'pre' middleware is essentially saying, that before anything is saved to the Db, We need to do the following things.
