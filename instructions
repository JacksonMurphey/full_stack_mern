1. Check to make sure that a repo has not been setup. Also Make sure that this folder isnt nested inside of a folder that already has a repo setup for it.
   -> In your terminal type: ls -al
   -> cd back up to parent folders if needed to check them as well.

2. Run this command in your terminal (as long as no repo has been setup): git init

3. Run this command in your terminal after initialization: mkdir server

4. Then run: npx create-react-app client
   -> This is the best practices naming convention going forward.
   -> When you run create-react-app, React would normally initialize or create a git-repo for you. Since we did this already, it knows to skip doing it for us.

5. Create a .gitignore in the root folder of your project.
   -> In .gitignore add: node_modules/
   -> Our client folder, which holds our react-app has a gitignore file as well. We created our root .gitignore b/c our server folder will also get a node_modules folder

6. Create server.js inside your server folder
   -> once done: cd into your server folder

7. Run: npm init -y
   -> This generates our package.json file (make sure in this .json file, that next to "main" : it has "server.js")

8. Run: npm install express mongoose

9. Go to your github acct. and create a new repo. Give the new repo the same name as the root folder we are working in. In this case it would be 'full_stack_mern'
   -> Once created, under the section with your 'git push' instructions, copy the remote add path, ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/JacksonMurphey/full_stack_mern.git
   -> cd from your server folder back to our root folder 'FULL_STACK_MERN'

10. Run: git remote add origin https://github.com/JacksonMurphey/full_stack_mern.git (we get this line from our github repo creation instructions under the push instructions)
    -> Once you have run this line, to ensure it ran correctly, run: git remote
    -> it should return: origin (This lets you know it worked)

11. Run: git add .

12. Run: git commit -m "first commit"

13. Run: git push (This will return an error fatal. In turn it will give us the correct push command to input)
    -> After you run the above line, you will get something back that looks like: git push --set-upstream origin master
    -> Now going forward, anytime you add to this project, you can simply run 'git push' and your new files will be added.

14. Run 'git push' after creating new files or after making changes to current ones. This will push the changes to the repo we have created.(This works after you have staged the files)

15. cd into your client folder, run: npm install axios @reach/router --legacy-peer-deps

16. cd into your server folder, run: npm install cors
